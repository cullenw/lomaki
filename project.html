                            <ul>
                                <li>More than 35 million people now live with HIV/AIDS. 3.3 million of them are under the age of 15.</li>
                                <li>Every day nearly 6,300 people contract HIV—nearly 262 every hour.</li>
                                <li>Over 4,000 people die a day from AIDS</li>
                                <li>2.3 million people were newly infected in 2012, 1.6 million people died from AIDS, and 210,000 of them were under the age of 15.</li>
                                <li>Since the beginning of the epidemic, more than 75 million people have contracted HIV and nearly 36 million have died of HIV-related causes.</li>
                                <li>70 percent of all people living with HIV live in sub-Saharan Africa, including 88 percent of the world’s HIV-positive children.</li>

                            <h3>Overview</h3>
                            <p>The Immunity Project is trying to hack HIV/AIDS with a vaccine that turns everyone into a “controller,” or someone with a natural immunity to the virus. The technology uses advanced algorithms, data analysis, and artificial intelligence to identify just how a controller’s “super-power” works, and give that power to anyone via a free nasal vaccine. It is one of the few nonprofits to be accepted into Y Combinator’s elite startup accelerator program.</p>

                            <h3>The Work</h3>
                            <p>Developing an HIV/AIDS vaccine has been the holy grail of the medical community for decades. Vaccines are typically designed by neutralizing antibodies, but that doesn’t work with the HIV virus because it is too smart and quick to mutate. </p>
                            <p>The Immunity Project takes a radically different approach.</p>
                            <p>When cells are infected by HIV, they send pieces of HIV protein, or “flags,” to their surface for the immune system to identify and attack. However there are hundreds of signals coming from cells, and most people’s bodies don’t have the ability to pick out the HIV cells from all the other noise, except for controllers. Their “immunity” to the virus is due to a unique targeting capability in their immune system that enables it to neutralize HIV molecules by hitting them in weak spots. (One out of every 300 people living with HIV is a controller).</p>
                            <p>Immunity’s algorithm sorts through the enormous amount of combinations of HIV genome and human immune system genetic data to figure out how controllers are able to keep HIV dormant. It’s like finding the life-saving needle in the haystack. 
                            The vaccine will not contain killed, live, or genetically-modified viruses. It also will not require refrigeration, only requires one dosage, and can be delivered with a nasal inhaler -- all which address major distribution challenges in countries with high HIV infection rates. The vaccine also has the potential to act preventatively.</p>

                            <h3>The Story</h3>
                            <p>Dr. Reid Rubsamen is the cofounder and CEO of Flow Pharma, as well as the Immunity Project. He is a Board Certified anesthesiologist and served as Chief Resident in Anesthesia at Massachusetts General Hospital. He founded the Aradigm Corporation in 1990, a public pharmaceutical company that develops inhalation drug products. He has more than 65 patents for drug delivery technologies.</p>

                            <p>Dr. Rubsamen first met Dr. David Heckermann, who wrote Immunity’s algorithm, at Stanford Medical School. Heckermann developed the algorthim with his colleagues at Microsoft e-Science Research. It is based on similar principles to spam filtering software, because both spam and HIV spread rapidly, mutate relentlessly, and have a multitude of variations. Microsoft Research contributed $1 million to the project in 2011. </p>

                            <p>Immunity’s other cofounder Naveen Jain is also the CEO of Sparkart, a digital agency that works with major entertainment and sports brands, as well as startups, to design great products and grow their audience. Chief Science Officer Charles Vincent Herst also works at Flow Pharma, and previously worked at Zogenix, RED Laboratories, and Aradigm.</p>

                            <p>The Immunity Project is a partnership between medical device company Flow Pharma and digital agency SparkArt.</p>

                            <h3>Where the Money Will Go</h3>
                            <p>Getting a vaccine into the market is a long and laborious process. The Immunity Project still has years of work, experimentation, clinical trials, and federal approvals to get through. All this will require tens of millions of dollars. Immunity is raising $25 million right now to begin Phase 1 FDA human trials, which it hopes to begin in December 2014. The third and final phase of clinical trials and widespread vaccination efforts won’t happen before 2016.</p>

                            <h3>Why Lomaki Picked Immunity</h3>
                            <p>HIV/AIDS is one of the most deadly epidemics the world has ever seen. Despite decades of research and activism, no significant progress has been made. The biggest step forward was the commercialization of antiretroviral drugs, which are expensive, complicated to administer, cause serious side effects, and only manage the virus. 
                            The Immunity Project applies innovative thinking and cutting edge technology to cut through decades of stagnation. The vaccine has the potential to save millions upon millions of lives, with an impact and on a scale never seen before. HIV/AIDS would no longer be a death warrant. It would no longer have the power to rob people of their life at a young age, tear apart families, and decimate segments of the population.</p>

                            <p>We can do better -- it’s time for a paradigm shift.</p>
